## Project Notes
This website is my final project for ITAS 191 - Web Authoring from my first semester. The website only used HTML, CSS/layout (using Bootstrap) and some simple JavaScript (No react, Vue or other framework).

## Style Notes

There are two CSS style sheets that I created:
	1. mystyle.css
	2. listingStyle.css

Here is some information for my CSS style sheets:
 - .text-underline-hover, .text-color-hover:hover (class) for adding underline to the text and changing the text colour to red. 
 - Navigation bar
    -  search icon: search bar expands when clicking the search icon, text colour/background color for search bar.
    -  navigation bar position/size/color before scrolling. changing the navigation item background when the mouse hovers
 - Jumbo search bar
    - expands the search bar when clicking on it.
    - position(padding/margin) of the search bar
    -  -webkit- for safari
 - Carousel album
    - text on top of the picture
    - the style for the carousel
 - phone icon fixed position at the bottom left
