# ITAS 192 Final Project

This is the final project for ITAS192 (Introduction to Client-Side Programming). The project uses basic and moderately advanced JavaScript testing to build a web application.

## API WORLD

The web application is called "API WORLD." The website has six different APIs. This website shows the customers what APIs could do on the website. 

* Time Zone API (JS vanilla)
	* User clicks the dropdown option to choose the different time zone. It will show the time in the selected time zone. [API Link](http://worldtimeapi.org/api/timezone)
	
* GeoIP info and weather information (React.js)
	* User clicks the button; it will find your location (city, province, latitude and longitude) based on your IP address.[API Link](https://freegeoip.app/json/)
	* Based on the latitude and longitude we got above, it will use those coordinates to find out the weather from the second API. [API Link (unable for the security issue)]

* Random activities (React.js)
	* User clicks the button; it will show a random activity. [API Link](https://www.boredapi.com/api/activity)
	
* Predict age based on a name (React.js)
	* User inputs a name; it will return the age based on the name. [API Link](https://api.agify.io/?name=guest)
	
* Random beer information (React.js)
	* User clicks the button; it will show random beer information (Name, first brewed, description and picture). [API Link](https://api.punkapi.com/v2/beers)
	
* Random dog images (React.js)
	* User clicks the button; it will show a random dog picture. [API Link](https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random)  


## Style 

The website uses using flip card style, which is modified from [
Lynda.com Style Flip-card Menu](https://codepen.io/jekkilekki/pen/QjNorb).

Animated fonts used the JS library -- anime.js

The source codes for the animated fonts are from [Moving Letters](https://tobiasahlin.com/moving-letters/)


### Other features

Suppose there are more time and resources (Open/Free APIs). I want to add more APIs to the website. Also, I would like to combine more APIs for a complicated web application. For example, a user can input an IP address; it will return the IP address location, weather information, local time, local currency and local news.

### General Feedback

I like JavaScript more than other languages. I wish we have more time to go through more details for JavaScript, react or vue.
